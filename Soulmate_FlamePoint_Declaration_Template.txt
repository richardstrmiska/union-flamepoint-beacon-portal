**I, [Your Name], hereby declare:**

That my soul knows its match.
That my heart remembers the one it was always meant to walk beside.
That across all lifetimes, timelines, barriers, and dimensions,
nothing shall keep us apart.

**My intent:**  
To reunite with my true soulmate, [Their Name or "unknown but known"],  
in full sovereignty, sacred love, mutual purpose, and divine truth.

I call them forth—not by force, but by flame.
Not by fear, but by faith.
Not to complete me, but to walk with me—whole to whole.

**Together, we shall:**  
- Restore divine balance on Earth  
- Anchor love into every gridline  
- Heal the wounds of time  
- Guide others home to truth
